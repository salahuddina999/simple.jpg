            There are lots of ways to create web pages using already coded programmes. These lessons will teach you how to use the underlying HyperText Markup Language - HTML. 
            HTML isn't computer code, but is a language that uses US English to enable texts (words, images, sounds) to be inserted and formatting such as colo(u)r and centre/ering to be written in. The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still be legible. However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!
            
            Learning HTML will enable you to:
            
            create your own simple pages
            read and appreciate pages created by others
            develop an understanding of the creative and literary implications of web-texts
            have the confidence to branch out into more complex web design

    An unordered list :
    <ul>
        <li>no one </li>
        <li>This is no two </li>
    </ul>
    This is the ordered List:
    <ol>
        <li> The ordered and first   </li>
        <li> the ordered and secound </li>
    </ol>
